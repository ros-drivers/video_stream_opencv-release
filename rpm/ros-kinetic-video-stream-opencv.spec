%description
The video_stream_opencv package contains a node to publish a video stream (the
protocols that opencv supports are supported, including rtsp, webcams on
/dev/video and video files) in ROS image topics, it supports camera info and
basic image flipping (horizontal, vertical or both) capabilities, also adjusting
publishing rate.
